# ray-equation-in-black-hole-PINN
We used the PINN technique for solving the ray equation in the vicinity

The black_hole-ipynb file it is used to predict the trajectorie of a ray of light with the inputs given in the same file. It is used for first simulations in diferents initial conditions to see how many epochs or pushpins are needed.

The black_hole_iterative.py is used for making statistics for a initial condition while by printing the error commited in a doc in multiple_agujero_negro.

All the models are keep in modelos_agujero_negro so they can be used by the plot file to make especific figures, and the pushpins are saved in multiple_agujero_negro.
